= UpdateOnlyChangedAttributes

This gem adds the update_only_changed_attributes method to ActiveRecord::Base.

This will pass a new hash to update_attributes, including just the data which is not present in the current object.
By this, it prevents MassAssignErrors, if already present data should be written to an object.

== Nesting

In the current stage, nesting isn't handled at all.
